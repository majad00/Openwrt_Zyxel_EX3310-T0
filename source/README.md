## 🏗️ Building from Source

### Important Notice

> **Rootfs is the only part of the firmware that can be built with open-source code.** The remaining components are proprietary and not shared. It does not mean that you can not create a firmware , actually everything in firmware can be modified except Kernel.

### Build Process

1. Download the required source files listed above
2. Place them in the `source/` directory, make changes
3. Use the provided tool (coming soon) to create custom firmware by modifying the rootfs part
   The tool will also signe the firmware , ready to flash.

### Coming Soon

- Build tools and scripts
- SDK files
- Cross-compilation environment setup
- Custom rootfs creation guide
